# Citi Bike Analysis

## Overview
NYC bike-sharing data was analyzed to create proposal for a similar program to be built in Des moines. The goals was to use this data in order to show investors that this would be a viable project and not be something specific to NYC.

## Results

### Number of Bikes vs Bike Ride Duration
![ss1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102814578/181867388-8609fc72-4bdf-4587-9521-07fe01b43fa4.png)

The majority of bike rides tend to last less than 30 minutes with very few ever reaching the hour mark. This could be due to destinations not being very far from bike locations, or usage is more focused on leisure.

### Bike Ride Duration by Gender
![ss2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102814578/181867389-d7940f17-0c2d-4693-b8f0-5309d9bed26c.png)

Male bike usage is prominent in comparison to other genders. About 70k more bikes were logged by male users.

### Weekday Bike Usage Stop Time

Weekday rides had peak stop times at 5:00pm top 6:00pm, and a notable stop time of 8:00am.

### Weekday Bike Usage Stop Time by Gender

Stop times among genders did not vary by much if at all. Peak stop times were logged at 5:00pm, 6:00pm and a notable time of 8:00am.

### Bike Usage By day 
![ss5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102814578/181867393-0d28c91d-519d-46eb-9549-bab2bd6615c9.png)

Over all subscribers logged the most bike usage from day to day in comparison to regular customers who did not have a subscription. Males logged the most usage over all by a substantial margin.

### Bike Usage by Start Time
![ss6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102814578/181867394-e7c84a5c-51f2-4c04-b114-a4dedbadeb45.png)

Peak start times of bike rides occured from 4:00pm to 7:00pm with 7:00am and 8:00am, being note worthy start times as well.

### User Types
![ss7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102814578/181867395-08d98988-e16f-47f2-9213-867224c42768.png)

Subscribers accounted for more than 75% of bike ride users.

## Summary
The analysis first covered the rider duration to help dertime what kind of usage is normal. This would hep tell if usage was for leisure, travel, or excerise, and paint a picture of the need for this kind of transportaion option. Checkout times were analyzed and helped clarify the need. It seems like prime checkout time was around 5-6 pm which points more to a work transportaion scenario. Bike usage by day of the week hepled narrtow in that the majority of usage took place on weekdays. While a good amount of usage did occur over the weekend, weekdays had a substantially larger rate or use.

The August start time usage showed that peak starting times occured at 7-8 am and 4-7 pm. The usage was relatively high through the day. This could show that usage for leisure or excercise plays a larger role over all than work transportation.

Checkout times were then seperated by gender. This data can be used to compare NYC gender distribution, to the bike riding gender usage and help give us a proportion that we could apply to the Des Moines population.

The over all user type shows taht the vast amjority of users are subscribers. This could help with marketing to target a subscriber based plan vs a widespread use. People who tend to use the bikes use them regularly and not sporadically.

This analysis could be more polished if there was a data from other months besides august to see how weather impacts bike usage. Another comparison I would likee to see would be cost of bike repairs. There is data on whoch bikes are repaired the most, but cost data would help determine potential overhead needed.
